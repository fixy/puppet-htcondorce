[SLURM]
; This section has settings for configuring your CE for a Slurm job manager

; The enabled setting indicates whether you want your CE to use a PBS job 
; manager
; valid answers are True or False
enabled = FALSE

; The slurm_location setting should give the location of slurm install directory
; On rpm installations, this should be /usr if the slurm binaries (qstat, qsub, etc.) 
; are in /usr/bin
slurm_location = /usr

; The job_contact setting should give the contact string for the jobmanager 
; on this CE (e.g. host.name/jobmanager-pbs)
;
; Since we're using the PBS emulation in Slurm with the globus jobamanger,
; the jobmanager should be set to pbs 
job_contact = host.name/jobmanager-pbs

; The util_contact should give the contact string for the default jobmanager
; on this CE (e.g. host.name/jobmanager)
util_contact = host.name/jobmanager

; This setting is required if the SEG is enabled. This setting should point
; to the directory with your server log files for your PBS installation so
; that the SEG module can monitor jobs running on your cluster. 
;
; If you enable the SEG, you will need to change this and point it at a valid 
; directory
log_directory = UNAVAILABLE

; Hostname of the machine hosting the SLURM database. This information is needed
; to configure the SLURM gratia probe.
db_host = UNAVAILABLE

; Port of where the SLURM database is listening.T his information is needed
; to configure the SLURM gratia probe.
db_port = UNAVAILABLE

; Username used to access the SLURM database. This information is needed
; to configure the SLURM gratia probe.
db_user = UNAVAILABLE

; The path to the file containing the SLURM database password. This information is 
; needed to configure the SLURM gratia probe.

; Name of the SLURM database. This information is needed
; to configure the SLURM gratia probe.
db_name = UNAVAILABLE


; This setting is optional and will allow globus to accept limited proxies if set. 
; Changing this is not needed for almost all sites. If set to True it will add 
; the "accept_limited" option into /etc/grid-services/jobmanager-managed-fork. 
; If it is set to False or not set then that prefix will not be added.
;
; By default this is set to False
;
; Most sites will not need to change this 
; accept_limited = False
